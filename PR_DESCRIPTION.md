## 📝 Notes

This PR transforms the Mitsubishi ASX 2011 Helper into a fully functional PWA while improving the navigation experience across all devices. The app now provides a native app-like experience with offline capabilities while maintaining all existing functionality.

The navigation has been simplified to use header links instead of a dropdown menu, making it more accessible and consistent across all devices. The PWA features ensure the app can be installed and used offline, providing a better user experience for car owners who need quick access to repair and maintenance information.
